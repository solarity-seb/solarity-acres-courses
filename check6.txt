========================================
‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES IDENTIFIED
========================================

üîß MINOR ISSUES (Non-blocking):

1. LAYOUT COMPONENT MODERNIZATION:
   - Some components still use `export let` instead of $props()
   - Mixed modern and legacy Svelte syntax in some files
   - Could benefit from consistent modern syntax adoption

2. CSS ORGANIZATION:
   - Large app.css file could be better modularized
   - Some CSS variables defined inline in components
   - Missing CSS custom property documentation

3. NAVIGATION CONFIGURATION:
   - Hard-coded navigation links in navLinks.js
   - Limited dynamic navigation management
   - Could benefit from CMS-driven navigation

üîç OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:

1. PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Custom cursor could use passive event listeners
   - Some components lack lazy loading optimization
   - Could implement component-level code splitting

2. DESIGN SYSTEM COMPLETENESS:
   - Missing component documentation/style guide
   - No design token validation system
   - Could benefit from atomic design methodology
